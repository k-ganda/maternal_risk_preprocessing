# maternal_risk_preprocessing

This README outlines the data preprocessing steps for the Maternal Risk Prediction Project, a ML project aimed at classifying maternal health risk into three categories; **High risk**, **low risk**, and **Mid Risk**. Preprocessing is a crucial step for preparing the data, ensuring the model receives clean and well-structured input.

All data preprocessing steps are detailed in the accompanying notebook. The questions below outline the key considerations and decisions made during the preprocessing phase:

1. What sources have you gotten your data from? Will you need to aggregate data from multiple sources?

2. In what format is the data currently? What format will you transform your data to?

3. What features are currently included in the data? What kinds of data exploration will you perform?

4. Do you have any preexisting hypotheses about the data? How will you test these hypotheses?

5. Is the data sparse or dense? How will you handle missing data or outliers?

6. How will you split the data into training/validation/testing sets?

7. How will you ensure that your dataset is unbiased?

8. What features do you currently think will be included in the training of your model?

9. What types of data will you be handling? Categorical? Numerical?

10. How will you transform this data for your model?

11. Where and how will you store this data?
